# CMAPSpatialDataPresentation
SQL Server Geospatial Data example I did for my presentation at the Main CMAP June 2014 Meeting

To get it up and running:
-Update the Web.config of the ASliceOfColumbia.Web to include your Database Connection String (it's at the end of the file)
-Update Line 5 of the Common/Constants.cs in the ASliceOfColumbia.PCL project to point to where you're going to host the WebAPI/MVC App (localhost, Azure etc.)
-Update the Views/Home/Index.shtml file on Line 15 to your Bing API Key (If you don't have one, you can get one here -> https://www.bingmapsportal.com/)

Any questions/concerns/comments please email them to jarred@jarredcapellman.com and I'll do my best to answer them in a timely fashion.
